# SubtractApp üí≥

A simple, client-side web app to detect potential recurring subscriptions from your bank statements (CSV or PDF exports). It analyzes transactions locally in your browser, identifies monthly-ish charges, and provides cancellation guides for common services. No data is stored or sent anywhere ‚Äì 100% private.

Built to help you review and manage subscriptions easily. Note: This is not financial advice; always verify charges manually.
